## 🕓 Closing Notes
You ever create a nice, functional system and you think to yourself "Wow this is such a nice, functional system! It's so intuitive to use too!"
And then like a month later, you decide "I can make this better. All I need to do is completely recreate the whole dang thing!"
Anyways, I decided to spin off the sigils from my Lobotomy Mod into their own mod, on the off chance someone wants to just use my very niche sigils (and maybe the other stuff included).

Ended up reworking quite a few of my sigils, overall I think I made them more interesting to use and hopefully gave them more general utility.
Had a lot of fun making all of them!

Status effects were a particular challenge to make, but fortunately my experience working on the API helped me rig something functional together.
It's super unintuitive in its current state, but I didn't design it with public use in mind so...whoops.
I may end up spinning it off into its own mod once I inevitably rework how they're created and implemented.
In other news, Project Moon released an entirely new game in the time it took me to release Lobotomy mod 2.0, so there's already some potential ideas for future status effects in the future~.

And yes, I'll eventually make cards/abilities based off the Limbus abnormalities, why wouldn't I subject myself to more of this work?
Real life's made for functional, well-adjusted people, I don't need to figure out how to cook for myself! Two cheese sticks and an apple for lunch, s'il vous plaît.
