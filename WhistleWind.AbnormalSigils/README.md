Status effects are a unique kind of special ability that is displayed on the card.
Status effects are intended to be inflicted onto cards, behaving like temporary abilities.

## 🕓 Closing Notes
Pretty major changes this time around. Status effects are now much stabler than before - they even work in other Acts!
The biggest boon was the addition of rulebook redirects in the API; the biggest flaw with status effects in my opinion was the inability to see what they did until they were actually applied to a card.
I'd actually been working on this sort of redirect system for a while now, but couldn't figure it out until recently when I decided to move all my work over to the API.
I hope you find the redirects as cool as I do!

For other changes with this update, I ended up reworking some sigils that I was dissatisfied with for various reasons.
I'm quite satisfied with how the reworks came out, let me know what you think of them!

And finally and perhaps most pertinent for players - new sigils!
Wanted to put together a more varied selection of effects, so we've got more status effects, some slot modifications, and some more esoteric abilities.
If you're familiar with Project Moon you'll probably recognise the inspiration for several of them, and since I work on this mod in tandem with the main content mod you can probably guess what expansions I'm working on ;).

Speaking of Lobotomy Mod, expect some major internal refactoring for that mod as well.
Not sure how radical the changes will be, but I do want to make a token effort at least to make all my mods multi-Act compatible.

That's all for now, until next time!
