# WhistleWind's Lobotomy Corp Mod

### Face the Fear. Make the Future.

Inspired by KingSlime's mod of the same subject, this mod is my own take on translating the abnormalities of Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina into Inscryption.
The cards in this mod are designed to be as faithful to their original counterparts as possible while still being "balanced".

Current Features:
- 92 obtainable cards
- 8 starter decks
- 8 challenges/cheats
- 2 new choice nodes
- 4 new bosses

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies
- BepInEx-BepInExPack_Inscryption v5.4.1902
- API_dev-API v2.10.0
- WhistleWind-New_Spell_Card_Toolkit-1.0.0
- WhistleWind-WhistleWind_Abnormal_Sigils-1.0.0

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT 2.0 NOTICES ‚ÄºÔ∏è
With the 2.0 release, this mod's abilities have been split off into their own mod which you will need to download as well.
This mod now also requires Infiniscryption's Spell Card Toolkit, so be sure to get both!

The config file has also been reformatted, so any changes you've made to it will need to be carried over.

## ü©π Known Bugs and Issues
### Custom Bosses
Abnormal Bosses is not compatible with challenges that change the vanilla bosses (your game should run fine, but one challenge will override the other).
--------------------------

If you encounter any other issues or bugs, or you just want to give some feedback, you can @ me on the Inscryption Modding Discord.

## üîó Compatibility

## ‚öúÔ∏è Special/Hidden Abilities
A number of cards added by this mod possess special abilities that are not found in the Rulebook.

In the spirit of the original game, I won't detail the abilities, only which cards possess one and what triggers it.

You'll need to play with the cards in order to figure out their special ability does üôÉ.

## üé∞ Abnormality Card Choice Node
This special node can be found randomly after battles, and draws exclusively from this mod's pool of cards.

All obtainable cards in this mod have an internal Risk Level (Zayin, Teth, He, Waw, Aleph) based on their relative power level.
For each card choice, the game chooses a random Risk Level (based on the below probabilities) then selects a random card that has that Risk Level.

There's a low chance that instead of a regular card, you'll instead be offered a Rare card.
This is a separate probability roll that occurs after the initial roll, and it doesn't take Risk Level into account when determining which card to offer.

|Map #|Zayin|Teth|He|Waw|**Rare**|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|40%|30%|20%|10%|**0%/*2%***|
|2|30%|30%|20%|20%|**2%/*5%***|
|3|25%|25%|25%|25%|**5%/*10%***|

* Probability with the Better Rare Chances cheat enabled

## üïì Closing Notes
IT'S FINALLY OUT!!
This was a massive undertaking, but I'm very proud of how it's turned out!
My favourite part of this update were the custom bosses.
I tried to recreate their original boss fights, so they'll play a little differently than usual Inscryption bosses do.
Nevertheless, I hope you find them enjoyable to fight!

The next (and most likely final) content update will be adding the abnormalities from WonderLab.
This will only consist of new cards, so it won't be super major.

See you next time, and thanks for playing my mod! <3

Current plans:
* Further balancing, tweaking, bug fixes, and general refinement of what's currently added (feedback is welcomed and encouraged!).
