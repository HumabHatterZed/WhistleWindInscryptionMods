# WhistleWind's Lobotomy Corp Mod

### Face the Fear. Make the Future.
---
Inspired by KingSlime's mod, this is my own take on translating the abnormalities of Lobotomy Corporation into Inscryption.
The cards in this mod are designed to be as faithful to their original counterparts as possible while still being quote-on-quote "balanced".

Now featuring the abnormalities from Library of Ruina!

Current Features:
- 90* obtainable cards
- 11 starter decks
- 7 challenges and cheats
- 2 new choice nodes

* Not including special cards obtained via events

## 🩹 Bug Reporting and Feedback
If you encounter any issues or bugs, or you just want to give some feedback, you can find me on the Inscryption Modding Discord.

## 🔗 Mod Compatibility
### Modded Custom Bosses
Mods that replace vanilla bosses may override or be negated by the Abnormal Bosses challenge.

### Pack Management API
If you have [Pack Management API](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/Infiniscryption/Pack_Management_API/) installed,
a custom card pack will be created representing this mod. That's all :\).

### Achievements API
If you have [Achievements API](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/Infiniscryption/Achievements/) installed,
you will be able to unlock 11 different achievements.

## Nodes

### Ordeals
Ordeals are a unique battle type that require you to defeat a set number of enemies in order to win.

During an Ordeal, you cannot beat the opponent by dealing direct damage to them.
While you can still deal direct damage, the scale will not tip beyond +4, and half of any excess direct damage you deal will be instead converted into Bones.

Ordeals come in four different difficulty levels: Dawn, Noon, Dusk, and Midnight; and each one pull from a pool of possible Ordeal types.
There are six types in total, each featuring a different theme and set of enemies and mechanics.

|Difficulty|Possible Ordeals|
|:-|:-|
|Dawn	|Green, Crimson, Violet, Amber|
|Noon	|Green, Crimson, Violet, Indigo|
|Dusk	|Green, Crimson, Amber|
|Midnight|Green, Violet, Amber|

The possible difficulties you can encounter depends on the region, with higher difficulties becoming more frequent as you progress through a run.
An Ordeal's difficulty can be determined by looking at its map node, though you need to enter the battle to know its type.

In total, there are eight different Ordeal nodes you can encounter, one for each difficulty plus an equivalent Totem variant.

### 🎰 Abnormality Card Choice Node
A unique card choice node that exclusively offers Abnormality cards based on their Risk Level.

Risk Level is an internal designation that broadly correlates to how powerful a card is.
From least to most powerful, they are: Zayin, Teth, He, Waw, and Aleph.

Rather than randomly choosing three cards from the entire pool of obtainable cards, the game will instead select three random Risk Levels to draw cards from.
The probabilities for each Risk Level are based on the current region, with higher levels becoming more common as you progress (see below table).

There is a separate chance that instead of a regular card, you will be offered a Rare card instead (maximum of one per node).
Rare cards are not selected based on their Risk Level.

|Region|Zayin|Teth|He|Waw|**Rare**|
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|35%|35%|20%|10%|**0% (2%\)**|
|1|20%|30%|30%|20%|**2% (5%\)**|
|2|25%|25%|25%|25%|**5% (10%\)**|

( ) Probability with Better Rare Chances anti-challenge active

Note that Aleph-level cards are all Rare, and that these probabilities are rolled three times for each card choice.

### 🎰 Seiphirah Card Choice Node
This special node can be found randomly after battles, and draws from a pool of unique talking cards.
These talking cards are based on the Sephirah (plus Angela) of Lobotomy Corporation.
If all talking cards have been obtained in a single run, then this node will offer 3 random death cards instead.

## 🕓 Closing Notes

Another update, this time featuring the WonderLab abnormalities and the Ordeals!



Outside the new content, I also took the time to go back and clean up some of the older and messier code,
which if anything will make building off of it easier to manage.

So to summarise current plans for this mod:
- WonderLab expansion
- Second boss

Whether or not these come to fruition is entirely arbitrary, but the WonderLab expansion is already semi-in-progress.
