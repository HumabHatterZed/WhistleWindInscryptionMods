# WhistleWind's Lobotomy Corp Mod

### Face the Fear. Make the Future.

Inspired by KingSlime's own mod of this topic, this is my own take on translating Lobotomy Corp's abnormalities into Inscryption.

The cards in this mod are designed to be as faithful to their original counterparts as possible within the framework of Inscryption's gameplay, while still being "balanced".

This mod currently adds all abnormalities from Lobotomy Corp. Broken down, this means:
* **```84```** obtainable cards
* **```41```** obtainable abilities
* **```4```** starter decks for Kaycee's Mod
* **```1```** custom node
* Plus a few combat events!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies
* BepInEx-BepInExPack_Inscryption v5.4.1901
* API_dev-API v2.4.0+

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING v1.1.0 CONFIGURATION FILE ‚ÄºÔ∏è
The mod's configuration file has been renamed to **```wstl.inscryption.lobotomycorp.cfg```**.

Any changes made in the old config file will **NOT** carry over and must be changed in the new config file after loading the game at least once.

The order of the configuration options has also changed, so simply copy-pasting the old config into the new *may* not work.

The old config can be safely deleted at your convenience.

## ü©π Known Bugs and Issues
### Hard to tell!
Because of the way Thunderstore works I can't (as far as I know) update this section of the ReadMe without updating the entire mod, so you'll have to check the Issues tab on the GitHub to see an accurate list of current bugs, issues, etc.

Chances are that if there are any game-breaking bugs I'll release a patch as soon as I become aware of it.

If you encounter any issues or bugs please report them to me asap by contacting me on the modding Discord or by opening an issue on the GitHub.

Feel free to contact me with any other feedback you have too!

## üíå Credits
Shoutout to Arackulele, divisionbyz0rro, and julien-perge for having public GitHubs for me to reference back to and ~~steal~~borrow code from.

Special mention to James Veug's ReadmeMaker mod for providing the cost sprites I use; you're a lifesaver!

Big thanks to Rengar, yam the nokia, Orochi Umbra, and everyone else on the modding Discord that reported bugs to me!

## ‚öúÔ∏è Special/Hidden Abilities
A number of cards added by this mod possess special behaviour unique to themselves that is not normally found in the Rulebook.
In the spirit of the original game, I won't be listing the effects here, only which cards possesses a special ability and what triggers it.
You'll need to mess with the cards to figure out exactly what they do üôÉ.

## üìá Abnormality Card Choice
This special node can be found randomly as a card choice after battles (and at the start of every region depending on the config) and draws exclusively from this mod's cards.

Uniquely, this node uses a special value called 'Risk Level' to determine what cards are drawn which acts as a general indication of their power.

The Risk Levels are, in order from least to most powerful: Zayin, Teth, He, Waw, Aleph.

The node randomly chooses one of the first four Risk Levels, and then randomly chooses a card that has that Risk Level.

For each card choice there is a chance that it will instead draw from the pool of Rare mod cards, disregarding the Risk Level.

The chances of a certain Risk Level being chosen or getting a Rare card changes based on the map number (you start a run on map #1, regardless of the region).

Note that all Aleph-level cards are Rare cards and thus aren't part of the regular pool.

|Map #|Zayin|Teth|He|Waw|_Rare_|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1/40%|30%|20%|10%|_0%_|
|2/30%|30%|20%|20%|_4%*_|
|3/25%|25%|25%|25%|_8%*_|

*If you're playing Kaycee's Mod the chance of drawing a Rare is halved to 2% and 4% for maps #2 and #3 respectively.

## üïì Closing Notes
