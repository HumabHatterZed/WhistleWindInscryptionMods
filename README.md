# WhistleWind's Lobotomy Corp Mod
Inspired by [name]'s wonderful mod, this is my own take on translating Lobotomy Corp's abnormalities into Inscryption.
The cards in this mod are designed to be as faithful to their original counterparts as possible, while still being 'balanced' (heavy air quotes there) relative to vanilla Inscryption.
This mod adds [card] obtainable cards, [ability] custom abilities, and [special] special abilities, with plans to add the remaining abnormalities in the future.

## KNOWN ISSUE
If you have your console set to log Debug messages, you WILL experience big lag spikes whenever you look at, draw, play, or even think of cards with special abilities.
This includes vanilla cards such as the Tentacles and Ants, and also affects looking at special abilities in the Rulebook.

To prevent this, simply disable Debug logging for your console in the BepInEx config.
Debug logging is disabled by default, so if you haven't messed with it you should be golden.
