# WhistleWind's Lobotomy Corp Mod

### Face the Fear. Make the Future.

Inspired by KingSlime's mod, this is my own take on adding Lobotomy Corp's abnormalities into Inscryption.  The cards in this mod are designed to be as faithful to their original counterparts as possible within the framework of Inscryption's gameplay, while still being "balanced".

Features:
* **```84```** obtainable cards
* **```41```** obtainable abilities
* **```6```** starter decks for Kaycee's Mod
* **```3```** challenges and **```1```** cheat
* **```1```** custom node
* Plus a few combat events!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies
* BepInEx-BepInExPack_Inscryption v5.4.1901
* API_dev-API v2.4.1

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR ANYONE UPDATING TO v1.1.0 OR ABOVE ‚ÄºÔ∏è
The mod's configuration file has been renamed to **```wstl.inscryption.lobotomycorp.cfg```**.

Any changes made in the old config file will **NOT** carry over and must be changed in the new config file after loading the game at least once.

The old config can be safely deleted at your convenience.

## ü©π Known Bugs and Issues
### Curses Mod Challenge Incompatibility
The Boss Revenge challenge from Infiniscryption's Curses mod will override the Abnormal Boss challenge if both are activate at once (you'll stll be able to play the run).

The Abnormal Boss challenge will still work for Royal since Boss Revenge does not affect him.

--------------------------

If you encounter any other issues or bugs, or you just want to give some feedback, you can @ me on the Inscryption Modding Discord.

## üíÄ Challenges and Cheats
|Challenge|Description|Points|
|:-|:-|:-:|
|Abnormal Bosses|Bosses will only play abnormality cards.|30|
|Abnormal Encounters|All regular battles will only use abnormality cards.|20|
|Miracle Worker|Leshy will play Plague Doctor during regular battles. Beware the Clock.|20|
|Better Rare Chances|Raises the chance of getting a Rare card from the abnormal choice node.|-15|

## Custom Card Choice Node
This special node can be found randomly as a card choice after battles and draws exclusively from this mod's pool of cards (including Rares!).

Cards are chosen based on an internal 'Risk Level' system that splits all cards into five categories, based on their general power level.

The chances of cards with a certain 'Risk level' appearing as a choice change as you progress in a run according to the table below.

|Map #|Zayin|Teth|He|Waw|_Rare_|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|40%|30%|20%|10%|_0%_|
|2|30%|30%|20%|20%|_4%*_|
|3|25%|25%|25%|25%|_8%*_|

_*This percentage is halved in Kaycee's Mod._

## üïì Closing Notes
Turns out I suck as a programmer >.<  But seriously, I don't know how I missed these cards not being obtainable, especially considering how important a few of them are for events.

In other news, work on the next major content update has started. There are some pretty substantial changes to a few existing cards, mostly to add a bit more variety in the gameplay (I had to add a new dependency to make it work, but it'll be worth it). No ETA on when it'll be done though :(.

That's all for now. As always, thanks for playing my mod! <3

Current plans:
* Further balancing, tweaking, bug fixes, and general refinement of what's currently added (feedback is welcomed and encouraged!).
* Expansion pack of Library of Ruina abnormalities
