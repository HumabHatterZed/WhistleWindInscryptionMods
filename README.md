# WhistleWind's Lobotomy Corp Mod
Inspired by KingSlime's wonderful mod, this is my own take on translating Lobotomy Corp's abnormalities into Inscryption.
The cards in this mod are designed to be as faithful to their original counterparts as possible, while still being 'balanced' (heavy air quotes there) relative to vanilla Inscryption.
This mod adds [card] obtainable cards, [ability] custom abilities, and [special] special abilities, with plans to add the remaining abnormalities in the future.

## Known Issues
### Debug lag
If your BepInEx console is set to output 'Debug' or 'All' log levels, you WILL experience massive lag spikes when dealing with cards with special abilities.
This includes vanilla cards such as Ants or Tentacles, as well as the Rulebook itself.

To prevent this, go to the [Logging.Console] section of your BepInEx config file, then for setting 'LogLevel' remove the value 'Debug' If you have it set to log 'All', just set to the default value..
'Debug' logging is disabled by default, so if you haven't messed with it you should be golden.
