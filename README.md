# WhistleWind's Lobotomy Corp Mod

### Face the Fear. Make the Future.

Inspired by KingSlime's own mod of this topic, this is my own take on translating Lobotomy Corp's abnormalities into Inscryption.

The cards in this mod are designed to be as faithful to their original counterparts as possible within the framework of Inscryption's gameplay, while still being "balanced".

### Major update v1.1.0 now released!

This mod currently adds all abnormalities from Lobotomy Corp. Broken down, this means:
* **```84```** obtainable cards (excluding evolutions, minions, event-exclusives)
* **```41```** abilities (excluding event-exclusive ones)
* **```16```** special abilities
* **```4```** starter decks for Kaycee's Mod
* **```1```** card choice node
* Plus a few special events!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies
* BepInEx-BepInExPack_Inscryption v5.4.1901
* API_dev-API v2.4.0

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è NOTICE ON v1.1.0 CHANGES ‚ÄºÔ∏è
The mod's configuration file has been renamed to **```wstl.inscryption.lobotomycorp.cfg```**.

Any changes made in the old config file will **NOT** carry over and must be changed in the new config file after loading the game at least once.

The old config can be safely deleted at your convenience.

A number of other internal changes have been made that _shouldn't_ break your game, but just in case it is recommended that you start a new run after updating.

Please see the full changelog (included in the download package) for a full breakdown of what exactly has changed.

Card and ability changes will be listed in the Changelog section below, of course.

## ü©π Known Bugs and Issues
### Hard to tell!
Because of the way Thunderstore works I can't (as far as I know) update this section of the ReadMe without updating the entire mod, so you'll have to check the Issues tab on the GitHub to see an accurate list of current bugs, issues, etc.

If you encounter any issues or bugs please report them to me asap by contacting me on the modding Discord or by opening an issue on the GitHub.

Feel free to contact me with any other feedback you have too!

## üíå Credits
Shoutout to Arackulele, divisionbyz0rro, and julien-perge for having public GitHubs for me to reference back to and ~~steal~~borrow code from.

Special mention to James Veug's ReadmeMaker mod for providing the cost sprites I use; you're a lifesaver!

Big thanks to Rengar, yam the nokia, and everyone else on the modding Discord for reporting bugs to me!

## ‚öúÔ∏è Special Abilities
A number of cards added by this mod possess special behaviour not normally found in the Rulebook.
In the spirit of the original game, I won't be listing the effects here, only which cards possess a special ability and what triggers it.
You'll need to mess with the cards to figure out exactly what they do üôÉ.

## üìú List of Obtainable and Minion Cards
**NOTES**
* **Singleton** means you can only have a single copy of that card in your deck  at a time (like Ouroboros).
* **Poisonous** means the card will kill survivors at the campfire when eaten.
* **X** means that that stat varies (typically because the card in question inherits its stats from somewhere else).

## üìá Abnormality Card Choice Node
This node only draws from the pool of obtainable mod cards, including Rares!

Each card has a Risk Level which determines the probability that they'll be selected as a card choice at this node.

The Risk Levels are, in order from least to most rare: Zayin, Teth, He, Waw, Aleph.

For each card choice there is a chance that it will instead draw from the pool of Rare mod cards, bypassing the Risk Level mechanic.

The exact probabilities for each Risk Level and for Rare cards changes as you progress, as seen below.

Note that all Aleph-level cards are Rare cards and thus aren't part of the regular pool.

## üïì Future Plans
Congrats on scrolling all the way down here! Below are a few things that I'll be working on in the future, or at least plan on doing.

* Further balancing, tweaks, bug fixes, and general refinement of what's currently available (feedback is welcomed and encouraged!).
* Further expansion pack of Library of Ruina abnormalities
* Challenges and Anti-Challenges (Cheats)

<!---
* Custom challenges.
* Ordeal battle node? Depends on whether ordeals are abnormalities or not, I'll have to check the _Lore_.
* Items?? Possibily convert some tool abnormalities into items (or not, I'll figure it out).
* Maybe bosses??? they can't be _that_ hard to make and implement, I'm sure. --->
