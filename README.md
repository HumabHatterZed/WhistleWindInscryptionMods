# WhistleWind's Lobotomy Corp Mod

### Face the Fear. Make the Future.

Inspired by KingSlime's mod of the same subject, this mod is my own take on translating the abnormalities of Lobotomy Corporation into Inscryption.
The cards in this mods are designed to be as faithful to their original counterparts as possible while still being 'balanced'.

Current Features:
* 94 obtainable cards
* 51 obtainable abilities
* 6 starter decks for Kaycee's Mod
* 8 challenges/cheats
* 1 custom choice node
* 4 custom bosses
* And a few combat events!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies
* BepInEx-BepInExPack_Inscryption v5.4.1902
* API_dev-API v2.4.1
* Infiniscryption-Spell_Card_Toolkit-2.0.0

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT NOTICE ‚ÄºÔ∏è
**THIS MOD NOW REQUIRES `INFINISCRYPTION'S SPELL CARD TOOLKIT` IN ORDER TO FUNCTION!!**

Please make sure you have Spell Card Toolkit installed before playing!

## ü©π Known Bugs and Issues
### Custom Boss Challenges
Any challenge that changes the vanilla bosses or replaces them with custom bosses is incompatibible with this mod's challenges that do the same (Abnormal Bosses, Apocalypse, etc.).

--------------------------

If you encounter any other issues or bugs, or you just want to give some feedback, you can @ me on the Inscryption Modding Discord.

|Abnormal Bosses|Bosses will only play abnormality cards.|30|

## üé∞ Abnormality Card Choice Node
This special node can be found randomly after battles, and draws exclusively from this mod's pool of cards.

All obtainable cards in this mod have an internal Risk Level (Zayin, Teth, He, Waw, Aleph) based on their relative power level.
For each card choice, the game chooses a random Risk Level (based on the below probabilities) then selects a random card that has that Risk Level.

There's a low chance that instead of a regular card, you'll instead be offered a Rare card.
This is a separate probability roll that occurs after the initial roll, and it doesn't take Risk Level into account when determining which card to offer.

|Map #|Zayin|Teth|He|Waw|**Rare**|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|40%|30%|20%|10%|**0%/2%***|
|2|30%|30%|20%|20%|**2%/5%***|
|3|25%|25%|25%|25%|**5%/10%***|

## üïì Closing Notes
IT'S FINALLY OUT!!
This was a massive undertaking, but I'm very proud of how it's turned out!
My favourite part of this update were the custom bosses.
I tried to recreate their original boss fights, so they'll play a little differently than usual Inscryption bosses do.
Nevertheless, I hope you find them enjoyable to fight!

The next (and most likely final) content update will be adding the abnormalities from WonderLab.
This will only consist of new cards, so it won't be super major.

See you next time, and thanks for playing my mod! <3

Current plans:
* Further balancing, tweaking, bug fixes, and general refinement of what's currently added (feedback is welcomed and encouraged!).
