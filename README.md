# WhistleWind's Inscryption Mods

Welcome to the Git repository for all my Inscryption mods!
Here you'll find the files for every original mod I've ever made for Inscryption, tucked into its own li'l folder.

If you're a mod creator yourself (or looking to be one), feel free to use any of the code that's found here. I try to do a little bit of everything, so you should hopefully find something useful!


## WhistleWind Lobotomy Mod
Inspired by KingSlime's mod of the same subject, this mod is my own take on translating the abnormalities of Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina into Inscryption.
The cards in this mod are designed to be as faithful to their original counterparts as possible while still being "balanced".

## Abnormal Sigils
A library of 52 unique sigils based on the abnormalities from Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina.

## New Spell Card Toolkit
This is an updated version of DivisionByZ0rro's original [Spell Card Toolkit](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/Infiniscryption/Spell_Card_Toolkit/).
This mod seeks to improve upon what was left behind through bug fixes and minor content additions.

## Mod Debugging Mod
An internal-use-only mod I use to debug my mods.
