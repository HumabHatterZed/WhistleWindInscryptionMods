# WhistleWind's Inscryption Mods

Welcome to the Git repository for all my Inscryption mods!
Here you'll find the files for every original mod I've ever made for Inscryption, tucked into its own li'l folder.

If you're a mod creator yourself (or looking to be one), feel free to use any of the code that's found here. I try to do a little bit of everything, so you should hopefully find something useful!

Current mods are:
- WhistleWind's Lobotomy Mod 2.0
- WhistleWind's Lobotomy Mod 1.3
- Abnormal Sigils
- New Spell Card Toolkit
- Mod Debugging Mod (internal use only)
